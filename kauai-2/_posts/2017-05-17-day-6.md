title: "flying home"

Woke up, finished packing and cleaning up, grabbed breakfast at [La Spezia](http://www.laspeziakauai.com/) (more because they had normal brunch food than because their food is *that* good, but it is good), but I still had sausage, eggs, and rice. From there, we gassed up, drove to the airport, and took off.

The flight to Honolulu wasn't bad, but the flight from Honolulu to OAK was rough. Crying kids on a flight isn't bad. If anything, the kids are just expressing how we all feel, so in a way it's a release. Parents being shitty to their crying kids though, that's aweful.
