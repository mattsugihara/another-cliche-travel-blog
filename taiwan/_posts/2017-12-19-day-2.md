We got up and got breakfast at the hotel, then walked over to the pier 2 art district. along the way, we walked through a park where old women were doing the flappy arm thing Ali Wong talks about and got some boba.

The art district turned out to be a bunch of really cute boutiques, so we had some fun shopping around.

At one, we headed over to the Rose House at the former British consulate for afternoon tea. Not bad!

After tea, we picked up our bags and rental car and drove to Kenting. When we arrived, we found a pretty posh hotel, grabbed some dinner, and then passed out.
