Woke up around 8, got up by ten. had a cup of cofffee, considered starting to pack. it’s amazing, because just two years ago, I remember packing for a few week trip being a big deal.  Now it’s almost an afterthought. ran a few errands, went climbing. showered, polished my boots, then finished throwing stuff in a bag. Broke down and decided to bring both computers. Met up with Dina, Blake, Hannah and Colin at [Pesce e Riso]() for dinner, then stopped in at Lloyd’s for a bit of holiday cheer.

Got to the airport with plenty of time, but the check in line was huge, so they ended up pulling us and giving us all priority boarding. The flight itself was super easy, I slept through most of it. Dry, but otherwise unremarkable.
