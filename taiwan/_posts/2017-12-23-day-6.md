Today, we grabbed breakfast at the hotel, helped Amy with her chopstick skills, then drove out to Taroko National Park. It looked exactly like I’d imagined the land in those old Chinese paintings looked. Oh. My.

Afterward, we came back to the hotel, showered off, and then grabbed dinner at ()[]. If you’re ever in Hualien, go. Wade called it one of the best meals he’s ever had, and I can say for certain it was amazing! Amy struggled a little bit with her chopsticks, but she powered through! After, we palled around the night market and did a little shopping. One place, appropriately called -196&deg;C made ice cream using liquid nitrogen and countertop mixers! The vanilla and honey was super tasty and creamy (though Smitten still wins out in my book).
