title: "Myvatn to Hvammstangi"
---

Drove through Akureryi, stopped in at [Saudarkroksbakari](https://www.saudarkroksbakari.net/) in Sauðárkrókur for a cup of cofffee and a pastry, and then ended up in Hvammstangi. Just spent the day driving, mostly.

Had dinner at a pretty trendy place with only five tables filled. Small town on a wednesday night.

Stayed at an unremarkable hotel.
