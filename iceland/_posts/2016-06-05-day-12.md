title: "Bumming around Reykjavik"
---

Bummed around all day. I didn't get up till almost noon, so by two I made it out of the house. Walked around, got coffee, caught up on this, did some shopping.

For dinner, we went to [Public House](http://www.publichouselv.com/), which I *highly* recommend. It was a nice mix of British, Japanese, Chinese, and Icelandic, and included things like pork belly steam buns, chicken kara'age, and smoked puffin. Pretty great. Post dinner we took a long walk home and packed.
