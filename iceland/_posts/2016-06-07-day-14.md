title: "Bumming around Bergen"

Got up around 11:30 (after initially waking up at 6:30 to talk with Amy for an hour or so), then spent the day exploring the city.

We bummed around for a while, saw some pretty great graphiti, then went grocery shopping to prep for the hike the next day.

We then had a *great* roughly traditional dinner at [Pingvenen](http://www.pingvinen.no/), all locally sources food and many local beers (plus Sierra Nevada, because why not).

Post dinner, we got a bit more food for tomorrow, then headed back home for the night.
