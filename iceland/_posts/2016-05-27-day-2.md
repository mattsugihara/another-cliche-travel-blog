title: "Sleeping in"
---

I elected to skip the 8am hike and instead sleep in a little bit, grab breakfast, and just hang out. Kenny astutely pointed out the previous evening, "you're going to be in Jackson hole again, but when are you ever going to stay in a resort?" So I opted to take advantage of that.

Spent the morning and early afternoon hanging around the hotel waiting with the rest of the team to leave, then headed into town. Met up with Jin, Natasha, and Justin, grabbed dinner at [Local](http://localjh.com/). Perfectly fine but otherwise unremarkable.

After dinner they picked up their rental van for driving up to Yellowstone, and I went to bed.
