title: "The Merlion Statue"
---

Wednesday

Sarnies cafe for breakfast, then worked in the morning, then checked out the Merlion statue, walked around the bay, then grabbed satay from the night market thing at the base of the Google office. Talked about basic income, socialism, life, the universe, and everything with Mitch.
