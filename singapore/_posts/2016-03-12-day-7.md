Saturday

Breakfast at [Ronin](http://ronin.sg/), my new favorite cafe. Full stop. Had the best cappuccinos I've ever had, and French toast with whipped honey butter, pistachio crumbles, and blue berry compote.

After breakfast, walked around little India and Arab street. Sat out and had a couple beers and talked with Mitch

Grabbed the big bear burger (house-made bun, beef patty, egg, onion ring, sauce) at [I Am](https://www.facebook.com/Iamathajilane). Damn good burger.

Went to the [Gardens by the Bay](http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/), huge botanical gardens/arboretum thing. Quite pleasant. Realized once again how spoiled we are living in California. Half or more of the plants there grow like weeds back home. The California section itself was pretty amusing: mostly oranges with some grapes and thyme. Huh.

Dinner at [Lagnaa](http://www.lagnaa.com/) (Justin had the fish curry, Mitch had the chicken tikka masala, and like four mango lassie, I had the palak paneer). Good, but not really remarkable.

**2018 edit:** Looking back from, Ronin is still my favorite cafe in the world.
