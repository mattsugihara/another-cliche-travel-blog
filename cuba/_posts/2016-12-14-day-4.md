After the late night on the Malecon, getting up at nine to clear out of the house was rough. Luckily "moving" only consisted of packing up and walking across the street. We got settled while Naudereh and Anand went to the bus station to try to secure a ride to Trinidad for the next day.

Dina, Hanna, and I had a wonderful conversation with our host, Luis, about US-Cuba relations. 

Luis took us around the corner to the neighborhood cafeteria, Don Bello. The food was good by Cuban standards and we spent lunch discussing the different ways countries share wealth.

Attempted dinner at Chinatown, followed by dinner at Plan B. To get there we road in the only 1957 Plymouth convertible on the island.
