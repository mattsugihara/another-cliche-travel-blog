title: "So uh...Cuba"
---

Last night I texted Dina asking if she had any interest in visiting Cuba. With the way the world is going, this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to see how life is lived over there. Uncharacteristically, Dina had already gone to sleep for the night, but woke up the next morning and saw my text.

Turns out, Anand and Nadereh were just chatting her up about going. So uh...Cuba, probably gonna be there in a couple weeks.

**edit:** tickets purchased. 11 days.
