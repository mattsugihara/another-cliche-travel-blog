Woke up early, spent the day horseback riding. Kinda wanna make this more of a regular thing.

Post ride, we came back and showered. I bought the art piece I was looking at yesterday. Hopefully it's not too big to put above my bed.

Grabbed dinner somewhere (I had a cornflake crusted curry and lemon chicken that was surprisingly good), then met up with a few of the people we met riding earlier in the day. We went three rounds at this adorable bar whose owner looks exactly like Dina's cousin Mark.

Dina and I went on a futile search for wifi. Dina semi-befriended some drunk ass blonde, while her Chris Hemsworth looking boyfriend chatted me up, pawned a cigar off on me, which unfortunately had none of the redeeming qualities I hoped for.
