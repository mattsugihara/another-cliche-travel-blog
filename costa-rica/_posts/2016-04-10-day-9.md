Woke up early, around seven, and lazed about reading. Eventually packed, then took a car to [Chelles](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Restaurante-y-Bar-Chelles/374789079265518), a 24/7 restaurant purported to be open for over a century. Gallo pinos con huevos y carne. Great. After breakfast, we walked around San Jose, hit up a panaderia, then went back to the house to pick up our bags, then to the airport.
