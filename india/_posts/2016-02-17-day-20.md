title: "Delhi, again"

Upon Bethany's urging, I checked my flight info again and found an off by one error in how google figures travel arrangements. I'M GOING HOME!!!

India's been great, but I'm ready. This trip has made me realize that one thing I really value is potable tap water.

So, last day: we had brunch at the hotel, slowly got ready and answered work email, and left the hotel around 2:30. We walked over to Jantar Mantar, an observatory built in in the 18th century to tell time, now made unworkable by the surrounding buildings, then over to the India Gate, a arch built by the British to commemorate the young men they got killed fighting in wars on the other side of the world.

We got back to the hotel room, packed up, met up with Bethany's friend Ajit for dinner and ice cream, then headed to the airport.
