title: "Haus Kanz"

Grabbed breakfast in the morning and ran into Nancy in the lobby. We got her statues, then got food.

Bethany and I worked till almost 5, then we grabbed an Uber out to Haus Kanz, a cute little district.

Around 8, Bethany, Andy, and Nancy headed back to the hotel via metro, and I stayed and did s bit more window shopping. Ended up grabbingas kingfisher in a bar called Maquina, which was all done up to look like the cabin of an airship. There was some live music, but all told it wasn't enough to justify the Rs. 500 for the kingfisher. Oh well.

Caught an Uber back to the hotel and passed out.
