title: "Shopping"
---

Fell into the rhythm, slow mornings, then an outing in the afternoon/evening. Today, I hung out by the pool and worked, then around two, we took the subway out to greater Kailash and went shopping. The metro station was about two miles from the shopping district, so we took an auto rickshaw (tutu I if we were in Thailand) after walking through AIIMS (All India Instutitue of Medical Science) which is near I.I.T.

After shopping, we grabbed some food at a bar called Laidback (styleized with the first 'a' on it's spine), then took the metro back to our hotel. Everyone was passed out by 10.
