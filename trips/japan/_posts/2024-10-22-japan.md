We got up, packed up, and got breakfast at [Coffee Base BnA](). Katie had toast, I had a croque madame (both were fine),  and cappuccinos. The barista’s latte art was incredible!

Post-breakfast, we headed to the market, browsed around there for several hours. We got a late lunch at Din Tai Fung and then drinks at [Kobayashi Saketen]() before picking up our luggage from the hotel and taking the train to Osaka. It was hot and muggy, but we made it onto the train and 40min later found ourselves in the middle of a massive city. We walked the few minutes to our hotel, showered off, and went to bed.
