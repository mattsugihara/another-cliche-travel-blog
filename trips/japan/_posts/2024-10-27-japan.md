location: Atami, Tokyo

Woke up, had breakfast, took a taxi to the station, and then took a train to Tokyo. Once we arrived at our hotel, we dropped our bags, freshened up, and went shopping in Ginza. We had a late dinner at the hotel restaurant, where the caprese salad, made with locally produced burrata and dry farmed tomatoes, absoulely stole the show. I had a miso lasagna (cool concept, ok excecution), while Katie had a creamy chicken and mushroom pasta. We had planned to get a drink at the rooftop bar, but neither of us had the energy for it, so  instead they offered to send coffee to the room, where we called it a night.

Just as we were about to leave, they brought an adorable plate of fruit with a little chocolate placard congratulating us on our wedding and snapped a super cute Polaroid of us!
