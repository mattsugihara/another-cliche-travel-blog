location: Atami, Tokyo

For our last full day, we got up with loose plans to go check out the [Museum of Contemporary Art](), but ended up just walking around Tokyo. We got huge bowls of ramen from Ippudo, then wandered around Shibuya. We checked out Cat Street, and got coffee at [Chop](https://www.chopcoffee.com). We walked through Meiji Jingu, a super densely forested park, and walked out to a beautiful sky at sunset. We then walked back to Cat street, checked out the Coach there that was doing some super cute stuff, then headed back to the room.

Japan has [legendary manholes](), with each city having patterns unique to it, so while Katie hung out in the room, I went out and took a rubbing of one of the Tokyo ones. Fortunately, Japanese sidewalks are absurdly clean.

Rubbing collected, we got dinner at [SG Tavern](). We split some fried chicken, cold udon noodles in a truffle and whipped soy milk sauce (the consistency of yogurt), and a curry roasted cauliflower. The cocktails were the best I’ve had in years.
