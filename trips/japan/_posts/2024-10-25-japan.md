title: Day 11 (Sat)
location: Osaka, Atami

We woke up, ordered pancakes, a veggie scramble, and pastries, then headed to the train to Atami. It was a couple hours’ train ride and at one point we passed within a few dozen miles of Mount Fuji, which was
1. Massive
2. Shrouded in clouds
Combined, this means that we could see a little bit of the westerns slope.

The Atami station was packed with people and had a large public tub out front for soaking your feet. We took a quick taxi to the hotel and got checked in. After rinsing off and changing into our yukuta, we got a welcome tea with a little snack (consisting of pumpkin purée and adzuki bean paste sandwiched between two rice crackers).

We then had dinner and went to sleep.
