We got up, packed, and got the hell out of Tokyo. The Shinkansen was as easy and straight forward as advertised.

We arrived in Kyoto, got to our hotel, and freshened up. We walked out and found a little beer and whiskey bar run by a guy named Antonio, who was originally from Vera Cruz (by way of Boston and Virginia). Had a great conversation with him about living in Kyoto. After that, we grabbed dinner at Issho, a really good Korean barbecue place, and headed to bed.
