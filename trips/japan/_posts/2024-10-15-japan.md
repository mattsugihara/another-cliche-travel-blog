Woke up at at 5:30am. Flight to LAX was perfectly uneventful. We got a surprisingly decent breakfast at Planet Holleywood (bacon, eggs, ~fries~ hashbrowns, and a short stack), as the counter wasn’t even open to check us in for our flight. Better to arrive early with plenty of time than arrive late and miss our flight!

Once the counter opened up, we checked in and killed time at the lounge until it was time to board.

Flight from LAX to NRT was super easy. I did some reading, slept between meals, and watched Dune. Once we landed, we took the hour train ride from NZR to our hotel. We tapped in with our pre-loaded Suica cards (though I panic loaded an extra ¥9,000 at the fair gate), not realizing that seats were reserved. Fortunately, the person checking fairs was totally used to this, and we purchased our seats on a card straight from the train. Unfortunately, we had to tap out, so we made an unintentional (small) donation to the transit system. Oh well.

Once we got to the hotel, we got ready for bed and crashed as it was almost 10pm.
