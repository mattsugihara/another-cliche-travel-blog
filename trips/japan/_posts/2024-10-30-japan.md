Our last day! We got up early for breakfast a the fish market, then coffee from [Teron Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/teron_ginza/). We wandered slowly back to the hotel, stopping at the seven-story flagship stationary store Itoya, then the Sanrio shop in Ginza for additional Hello Kitty souvenirs.

We made it back to the hotel, packed up, managed to pack EVERYTHING into our suitcases, then headed to the airport. The lounge had decent food, and the flight home was easy!
