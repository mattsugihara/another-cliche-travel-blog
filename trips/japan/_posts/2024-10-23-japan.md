location: Osaka

We woke up, ordered coffee, oatmeal, and muslie to the room, then started our day with *wonderful* massages. After showering the oil off, we picked up a legendary fluffy cheesecake from [Rikuro’s](), got more gyoza and fried rice. We found that there was a Nintendo shop in the building, so  naturally we checked that out. They had an incredible selection of Nintendo merch, including an antique style Kalita box coffee grinder from Animal Crossing, then picked up a bottle of champagne, and Katie grabbed a beer at [Nito’s coffee & craft beer]() while I bought some magic cards.

We got dinner at the hotel, then headed to bed.
