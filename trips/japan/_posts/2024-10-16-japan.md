We woke up around 5:30, puttered around the room for a bit, then got breakfast at the hotel. I had udon, while Katie had tomagoyaki. We then got coffee at Turret Coffee, and then went to Nihonbashi. We walked around, then got a seafood donbori from one of Katie’s recs. Fortunately, the hour-long line to get in (there were only 20 seats or so) bought us enough time to get cash. The food was incredible: sea bream sashimi on the side in a thick, citrus/soy/* sauce, and an incredible mix of crab, scallop, eel, and fish over rice. Part way through, they add a wonderful tai dashi, turning it into an amazing ochazuke.

After lunch, we went back to the hotel room. I was starting to feel sleepy, so I got a quick workout in. After washing up, we went down to the lounge for happy hour. We had a glass of champagne looking out over the city, then headed back to the room.

For dinner, we ordered a black truffle risotto and vegetable curry from room service, and then promptly collapsed into a food coma.
