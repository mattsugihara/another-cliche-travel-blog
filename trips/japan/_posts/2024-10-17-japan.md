Katie’s day started at a jet-lag-induced 3:30, but I slept till 7. Once I was up, we grabbed quick coffees from the hotel, then headed to the fish market. From one vendor, we got strawberries and grapes on a skewer coated in a hard sugar shell. From another, we got an incredible set of nigiri, with Hana-toro, o-toro, and chu-toro. Both Katie and i preferred the o-toro, even though the Hana toro was marbled just like wagyu. We then got a skewer of A5 wgayu and were suckered into splitting a beer (as the hawker noted, it was already 5pm back home, and we’re on vacation!).

After we had our fill of the fish market (we think we arrived too late to see any auctions, so it was just a collection of food stalls), we got coffee at Hoshno Coffee, then went back to the hotel. After a nap, we got up and went to team labs Planet. Super fun!

We then got udon at Ton-something, and the did a little window shopping, looked at some watches, and headed back to the hotel.

After resting up, we rallied and headed out to [Champagine & Gyoza]() in Akasaka. They were pouring Pommery, so we each had a glass and reminisced about the creepy ass art gallery Pommery has set up in their wine caves. After dinner, we walked around a bit, tried to get into Bar Le Huit, but they turned us away (it was Smokey as hell in there, so not the worst outcome). After that, we turned in for the night.
