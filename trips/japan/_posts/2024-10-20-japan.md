We got up and got coffee at [Kissa Kishin Kyoto](), then hiked to the top of Fushimi Inari shrine. While it was super crowded, seeing the thousands of red tori gates was cool. The ice cream at the top was clutch! On the way back down, we stopped at [Vermillion Cafe]() for water, coffee, and a beer.

We wandered back towards our hotel, and took a nap. We rallied, and tried to get into Bar Rocking Chair, but they were booked up. So we got cocktails at an expat bar in a hotel. Neither of us were super hungry, but we got some gyoza from a small roadside shop, then went to bed.
