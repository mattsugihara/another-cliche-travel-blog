title: Day 10 (Fri)
location: Osaka

We had a slow morning, but eventually got up and had absolutely wild coffee at [Glitch](). Katie had an incredibly chocolately  flat white with Columbian beans, while I had a pour over that was so complex and delicate it was more like tea than coffee.

Sufficiently caffeinated, we got lunch at [An udon spot](), then wandered around Osaka looking for ceramics. We happened upon a [nice little park](), got some gelato, and accidentally found ourselves in Dotonbori. Katie bested **multiple** claw machines, then we headed back to the hotel.

We cleaned up, then grabbed drinks and bites at the beautiful hotel bar. They had their own takes on classics: I had a Smoking Chestnut (a brandy alexander), while Katie had their take on a strawberry blini. We got some bites, a crudite, spicy tuna on rice crackers, "okonomiyaki" (eggos + prosciutto + truffle mayo), "hassleback" potatoes (a potato round + mustard).

We then took advantage of in ofuro in our room, and went to bed.
