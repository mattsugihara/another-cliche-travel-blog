Woke up, had a very healthy Japanese breakfast, and then hung out on the property for the day. We read, relaxed, took a soak in our private bath, then took a quick sojourn to the 7-11.
1. Popcorn
2. Cheeto rings
3. Egg salad sandwich
4. Pork cutlet sandwich
5. Chocolate candy type 1
6. Chocolate candy type 2
7. Hi-Chew minis
8. Coke Zero

The pork cutlet sandwich was EVERYTHING I imagined it would be.

We had dinner, which Katie unfortunately started feeling ill part-ways through, and had to go back to the room. The staff was super accommodating though, and packed up the eel rice into onigiri for me to take back to the room for her.

After we took some time to digest and Katie was feeling better, we went to the onsen and enjoyed it. It had started raining lightly, and each pool was partially open to the sky, letting the rain in. It was lovely.

Post soak, we called it a night!
