Rented bikes, rode into town and got coffee at Lobita at the food hall. Went to the point, walked around. Got lunch at [El Tacos Del Diablo](), part of the Palmito food hall. Got tacos, beers, salads, chips and guacamole. Then after lunch, we rode up to the lighthouse, then up to the Tower of Love.

We then rode back to the hotel and had a low key evening, with dinner on the terrace.
