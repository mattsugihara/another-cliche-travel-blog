We woke up a bit late and got out of the room by one. We got coffee at [ARVO Coffee & Plants](https://arvobilbao.es/en/), and then wandered around Old Town. We got another coffee at [Beetle Bar](https://www.tripadvisor.es/Restaurant_Review-g187454-d10494782-Reviews-Beetle_Bilbao-Bilbao_Province_of_Vizcaya_Basque_Country.html), then watched kids done with school for the week play soccer in the middle of the new square over snacks from [Gure Toki](http://guretoki.com). We went back to the hotel, got a drink at the bar, then a remarkably good dinner as [Islares](http://islares.restaurant).
