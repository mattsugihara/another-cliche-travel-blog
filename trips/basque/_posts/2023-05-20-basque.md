Jet lag hit hard, and we didn’t end up getting out of the room until after 3. We got food at [Copper Deli](), and then spent a few hours at the Guggenheim. I discovered Pablo Palazuelo, and found his [Signo I](https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/la-coleccion/obras/signo-i) to be pretty cool! After we got out fill, Katie went back to the room, I took a short walk, then we had a nice quiet evening.
