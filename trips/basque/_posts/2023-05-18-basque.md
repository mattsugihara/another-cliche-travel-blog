Flight out was uneventful. Wasn’t able to upgrade, but we had two seats by ourselves, which made the flight better. Neither Katie nor I felt like we slept much, but the flight also passed much quicker than both of us expected. Once we landed at De Gaul, we got a bite to eat and a drink and killed a few hours. Out connection was uneventful, and we were in our hotel room before 11. We ordered dinner and a bottle of cava from room service, and then went to sleep.
