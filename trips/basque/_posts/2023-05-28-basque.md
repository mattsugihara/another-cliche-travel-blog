Woke up a bit earlier than we had, got breakfast at the hotel. Went back to the room before renting bikes again. Got a snack at [Shelter](), then walked around downtown. Stopped at a cool art show, where Katie found a piece she really liked called *Les maisons sont pluerent*

Dinner at Les Rosiers was disappointing. Three courses, beginning with the best octopus I’ve had, with chorizo, a carmelized red onion, and  With young pigeon for a main, and then a choice of chocolate or fruit for dessert. The chocolate was served with a green olive sorbet, but was otherwise unremarkable
