We rejiggered our plans! We’re heading to Biarritz a day early, shortening our stay in San Sebastián slightly, then leaving Biarritz a day early to meet up with Melissa and Guillaume in Bordeaux for a night, then continuing on to Paris for two!

Went to [ARENALES](https://www.instagram.com/arenales.bar/) for dinner which was INCREDIBLE. Roasted beets with almonds, roasted carrots with yogurt and mint, and bavette with chimichurri.
