Walked around San Sebastián. Walked up to La Castillo de la Mota and reread our vows to each other.

Saw some great views of the city, then on the way back down came across a random sign that read "Bar". So, we stopped and sat looking out over the city. I had a [Zumo](https://basquebeer.com/en/zumo-hazy-ipa-can-440ml-4-pack/), which was definitely the best beer of the trip. Katie had another glass of Txakoli.

For dinner we went to [Kokotxa](). They initially lost our reservation and service was a little shakey to start, but once the meal really started, it evened out. The food was great!
