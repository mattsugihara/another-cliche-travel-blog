Slow morning. Drove out to Cha Gorreana for some tea. Really nice. Beautiful landscape, grecloudy mountain tops rolling down to sunny coastlines. Saw some cows.

Sat out, had a few cups of tea.

Drove out to Furnas, got lunch at Terra Nostra. Got the price fixed menu.

- matt started with the mackerel ceviche, followed by the Cozido stew (and a glass of the 2011 Julian Reynolds reserve), then finished with an apple millefeuille. Pretty damn tasty.
- wade: Oxtail ravioli, cozido, cheese pudding
- tiffany: calamari with salted watercress, steak with a wonderful garlic sauce, and a chocolate mousse sphere in a puddle of passionfruit sauce

After lunch we walked around the adorable town, had a cup of coffee at a local bakery along with a queijo de vila (a baked custard) before heading back to Ponta Delgada.

We got back, showered, and walked around a bit, then ate dinner at (Taberna Açor)[], a tapas place around the corner from our place. Realistically, it was pretty much cheese with cheese and some cheese:

- bruschetta with cheese and mushrooms
- bruschetta with ham and cheese
- São Jorge with honey and bread
- a cheese board with some kind of mild, ricotta like cheese, a soft cheese that was similar to a slightly funky brie, and a semi-hard cheese sort of like parmasean

Then bed.
