We woke up late, lounged around, then got coffee at [Nomad](). Still fantastic. Got lunch (Croquettes, tuna tartar, shrimp, and bread) at [Pimento](), then spa and massages.

Post massage, we met up with Ivee and Chris at [Lluritu](https://www.lluritu.com/) for dinner. Fantastic stuff. Post dinner, we walked back to the hotel (with a slight detoure to a gelato place), and then bed.
