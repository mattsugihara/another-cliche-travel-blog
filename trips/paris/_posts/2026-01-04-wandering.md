We took it slow in the morning, wandering through Passage Dauphin to Bonjour Joacob for coffee. Had a nice conversation with a couple from Amsterdam living in Paris with their shiba inu Yuki (which apparently means "snow" and is a common name for female shiba inus). We then attempted to get viennoise from La Maison d'Isabelle, but the line was (predicatbly) nuts so we got some stuff from Bo&Mie. We walked around, eventually ending up on Ile Saint Louis. Got gallets from Creperie Ils Saint Louis (again! completely as good as we remembered). We then ended up at the Musée Carnavalet, got a beer at some brasserie, then headed back to the hotel to rest up for dinner.

Dinner was at [Roger La Grenouille](), an adorable little psot tucked back inside a little alleyway. I had the boeuf bourguignon, Katie had steak frites, and Melissa had a sausage and cabbage salad. Everything was great. We then ended up back at Le Hibou for a cognac nightcap and discussed the difference between an "hibou" and a "chouette" (chouettes have rounded heads, while hibou have feathery tufts like ears) before bed.
