location: Barcelona, Spain

We woke up late (maybe around 11), sleeping off everything from the previous day. The four of us walked over to [Slow Mov](https://slowmov.com/), then to [](), an oyster bar, for lunch. Walked around a bit more, did some shopping, got coffee from [L0t](https://www.lotroasters.com/). The space there was super cool, so it was nice hanging out there for a bit. I would have loved to try more of their chocolate, but I was still stuffed from the previous day. We headed over to [Tierra Tragame](https://www.instagram.com/tierra_tragame/), then laid low for a minute.

Dinner was at [Sartoria Panatieri](https://sartoriapanatieri.com/en/), which lived up to the reputation of having the best pizza in europe outside of Italy (and honestly was better than a lot of the pizza we've had *in* Italy). Stuffed to the gills, we tried for a cocktail at [14 de la Rosa](https://www.14delarosa.com/), but they were packed, so we settled for churros from [Xurreria Trebol/](https://www.instagram.com/xurreriatrebol/) and a little Mario Kart.
