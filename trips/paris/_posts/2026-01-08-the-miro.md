We woke up, got coffee at Nomad, breakfast at the hotel, and checked out. We got coffee again at Nomad, then headed over to Chris and Ivees. We dropped our bags, and headed to the [Joan Miro Foundation](). Got some great pics. Post that, we wandered vaguely in the direction of the magic fountain via a park, and posted up there for a while. Then we met up with Chris and Ivee at [Sips](https://sips.barcelona/drinkery-house/), then dinner at [Planxa del Bisbe](), which 100% lived up to our memory of it from last time.

Time shifter recommended I stay up and get bright light, so I'm writing this now, but will head to bed shortly.
