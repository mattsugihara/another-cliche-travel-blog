Woke up, wandered around! We walked by City Hall which was still decked out with Christmas decorations: pine trees, hot chocolate stands, and a double decker carousel! We hit up a few shops ([RSVP](https://rsvp-paris.com/), [Acne Studios](https://www.acnestudios.com/)). The [Picasso Museum](https://www.museepicassoparis.fr/) was cool, the building itself is GORGEOUS.

After we came back to the hotel, got drinks at [Le Hibou](https://www.lehibou-paris.com/), then a lobster roll and avocado grilled cheese from [Homer Lobster](https://homerfoodgroup.com/homer-lobster).
