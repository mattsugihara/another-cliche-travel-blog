title: New years day in Paris
location: Paris

We woke up to a very, very quiet city. Despite of the security threats, Paris went hard. Most things were closed, but we managed to get a good cup of coffee from [Bonjour Jacob](https://www.bonjourjacob.com/) before wandering along the Seine towards the Eiffle Tower. The lines for the Musée D'Orsay and Le Grand Palais were way too long, so after walking around we got another coffee from [Parallel Coffee](https://www.instagram.com/parallel.coffee/?hl=en). Sufficiently warmed, we took a quick river tour on the Seine, then got dinner at [L'Avant Comptoir de la Mer](https://camdeborde.com/les-restaurants/avant-comptoir-de-la-mer).
