Had a nice slow morning, then got up and walked along Luxembourg Gardins to get coffee from [Araku Coffee](https://www.arakucoffee.com/pages/nos-coffee-shop). It snowed overnight, so the grounds were dusted and white. They were totally undisturbed because the gardins were closed due to some security threat. Post coffee, we got Japanese sandwiches from [Yabaï](https://yabaisando.com/).
