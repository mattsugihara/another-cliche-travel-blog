Had a nice slow morning, then got up and walked along Luxembourg Gardins to get coffee from [Araku Coffee](https://www.arakucoffee.com/pages/nos-coffee-shop). It snowed overnight, so the grounds were dusted and white. They were totally undisturbed because the gardins were closed due to some security threat. Post coffee, we got Japanese sandwiches from [Yabaï](https://yabaisando.com/).

We met up with Melissa and did a bit of shopping at the christmas markets au [Bon Marche](https://www.lebonmarche.com/fr/noel) We got dinner at [Le Petit Bal Perdu](https://www.lepetitbalperdu.com/) (our waiter Thomas was fantastic, as was the food), then tried to get post-dinner drinks at Grouvie. It was closed for a private event, and some guy in the alleyway tried to get Katie to kiss him...at which point both Melissa and I swooped in. Instead we ended up at Pub Saint Germain. Post drinks, we ended up back at the hotel and went to bed. Except we didn't and instead went to town on the butter, cheese, and bread we had purchased earlier.
