For our last day, we woke up and got coffee at [Bonjour Jacob](http://bonjourjacob.com/) then walked Melissa to her dental appointment. Even though it was only a short bit away, the cold and wind made the walk a bit of a journey. After dropping her off, we went to the largest "para" pharmacie in Paris and stocked up on a few things.

Melissa's appointment was super fast (thanks nationalized medicine), and then we ended up walking around the 6th some more. We grabbed a brioche chocolat from [Aux Marveilluex de Fred](https://auxmerveilleux.com/), then back to [L'Avant Comptoir](https://camdeborde.com/les-restaurants/avant-comptoir-de-la-terre) (de la terre this time). Hunger sated, we gathered our stuff at the hotel and headed to the airport.

By this point, it had started snowing in earnest, and we were glad we had built in a bit of an extra buffer. Even though we didn't need it, had we left later, the chances that we'd have ended up stuck in traffic due to the first significant snow in nearly a decade was real. Our flight was delayed an hour, but was otherwise uneventful.

Once we landed in Barcelona, it was a quick trip to the hotel. The streets were packed with people out and about for the [Cavalcade of Magi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalcade_of_Magi), which we had no idea was a thing, but it didn't cause any issues.

We dropped our bags, and got dinner at [Can Framis](https://www.canframis.com/), a sister restaurant to [Casa Lolea](https://casalolea.com/). Touristy, but whatever, it's tasty. Post food, we went to bed.
