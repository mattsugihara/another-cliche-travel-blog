We woke up after a nap and made it to the airport without issues. Flight was uneventful, got breakfast from the Giraffe something or other in Heathrow, then boarded the plane home. We flew coach, but were towards the rear on the upper deck of the A380, so we had two seats to ourselves. We slept some, but not as much as either of us would have liked. As nice as the trip was, walking in the front door felt amazing.
