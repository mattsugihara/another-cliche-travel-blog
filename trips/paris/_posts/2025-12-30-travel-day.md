Used the [Timeshifter app](http://timeshifter.com/) to plan out a sleep/wake/light plan to hopefully combat jetlag. Smooth process getting packed and out of the house.

Got to the airport with plenty of time to spare. Once on the flight, I took a nap, woke up when they served dinner, then slept basically the rest of the flight.
