Once we landed, we got to our hotel without any issue, right across the street from L'Avant Comptoir! We dropped our bags, took a shower, then walked out to get a coffee from [Café d’Auteur](https://cafedauteur.com/content/16-coffee-shop). Their menu setup was pretty cool: A grid of drinks and different beans they'd brew each with. I got a cortado with beans from Equador? while Katie had a flat white with beans from Yemem. Both were good.

Freshly caffeinated, we strolled around, passing by the Notre Dame. We got back to the hotel and started getting ready for dinner. [Frenchie](https://www.frenchie-ruedunil.com/en/home/) once again did not disappoint with a five course and wine pairing. We got another glass of wine across the street after, then rung in the new year from the hotel room--The jetlag plan worked great, but it was still late!
