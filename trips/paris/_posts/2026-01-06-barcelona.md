We woke up late, then met Chris for a coffee (at [Onis](https://www.instagram.com/oniscoffee/), which was cute as hell and tasty) and mini walking tour of Barcelona. It was great catching up. We got lunch at [La Balabusta](https://www.instagram.com/labalabusta/), which was fantastic. Ivee joined us, then we wandered back towwards their apartment. We stopped at [Chocolate Amatller](https://www.chocolateamatller.com/), then hung out at their place while Ivee got some work done. For dinner, we went to [Bar Brutal](https://barbrutal.com/), got gelato on the walk home, then bed.
