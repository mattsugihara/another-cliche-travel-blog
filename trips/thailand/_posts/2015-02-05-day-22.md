We spent the day bumming around the old city, checking stuff out. Brunch was at this incredible restaurant, <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/MobileQueryBBox-g293917-d1218462-Blue_Diamond_Breakfast_Club-Chiang_Mai.html">Blue Diamomd</a>, that wouldn't have been out of place in Berkeley. Vegan, gluten-free baked goods, chia seeds, and avocados everywhere. After lounging there till around two two we rolled ourselves out of there and started to explore Chiang Mai.
