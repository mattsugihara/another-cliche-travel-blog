Last two dives this morning. Saw a turtle! The girl working the camera got a great shot of it (Finding Nemo totally nailed the stoner turtle look).

Did the tourist thing and bought the video so I can cherish the experience forever. I was worried if I didn't buy it I wouldn't be able to properly cherish it.

Felt exhausted, so I crashed early. Everyone else did drunken acro yoga on the beach. Not a bad day.

If you don't have the video, the experience didn't happen. Don't you know that? Glad you learned it before your life never happened.  BTW, what is drunken acro yoga and was my daughter a party to what sounds like debauchery?
