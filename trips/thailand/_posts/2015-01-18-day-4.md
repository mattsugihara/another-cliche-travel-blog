### The Train Market

This market lies along side/on top of railroad tracks. It's shoulder to shoulder stretching for about a mile with vendors selling everything. If it's edible, it's here. All too mellow chime goes off just before the train come trundling through, and everyone calmly packs away their stall 30 seconds before it arrives, the train passes, then everything picks up where it left off. Weird.

### The Floating Markets

The *Floating Market* sounds pretty badass, so we thought it would be cool to check out. Turns out it's a god forsaken tourist trap, so we bailed on it in favor of coffee and people watching.
