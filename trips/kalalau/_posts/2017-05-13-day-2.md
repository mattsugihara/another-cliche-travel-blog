Beach. And then some more beach where we met our neighbors, Abby, Brittney, and Leah, and their two friends, all from Oahu (-ish. Many were from the Midwest, went to school in Santa Cruz, then moved out to Hawaii). Then a nap and some reading. Then beach.

We ate dinner early, maybe around 6, and just kinda hung out with the cat.

Then sunset.

At sunset, Sophie and I started dancing on the beach and Abby, ran over and offered to take a video of us dancing on the beach. We politely declined, but she invited us over to some singing bowls being played. We grabbed our headlamps and headed over. We stayed a short while then peaced out. A little bit too woo woo. We stargazed for a bit, then called it a night.
