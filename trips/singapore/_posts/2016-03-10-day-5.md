title: "Exploring Arab Street and the Indian quarter"
---

Thursday

Work in the morning, finished around lunch time. Checked out Arab street while everyone else worked. Poked my head into supermama, a cute little Japanese shop with amazing pottery and stuff, but they hadn't opened yet. Told me to come back tomorrow at 7 for their opening party.
