Sunday

Cafe Ronin in the morning (iced latte and the dirty ronin sandwich, bread, emmentaler, "chorizo", more like linguica, hard boiled egg, and lettuce)

Cab ride to Changi airport.

They have a butterfly garden, crayon rubbing station for kids, a koi pond.

Flight to TPE was uneventful.

Got mediocre veggie ramen. Boarded flight to SFO. Was happy to be home.
