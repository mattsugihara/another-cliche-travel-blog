Tuesday

Sarnies for breakfast, work. Got positively drenched on the walk back from the office to the hotel. Managed to borrow an umbrella from reception, but it was nearly useless.

Got changed, went to [Blue Ginger](http://www.theblueginger.com/) for dinner. Not a crowd pleaser. Not bad, but not good.
