Title: "More wandering around Florence"
Location: “Florence"
---
Woke up, got coffee, then spent the day wandering around. We got coffee at [Rivarno](), then grabbed sandwiches from [Retrobottega](https://www.retrobottegafirenze.com). Katie grabbed drinks from the market, and we took it all back to the Airbnb. After lunch, we walked over the Ponte Vecchio. Got coffee, canoli, and other sweets, then sat out for a bit. We then wandered up past the Duomo. We then went to the Central Market, hit up the Lego store, then back to the Airbnb for a nap.

After we woke up from an incredible nap, we headed to a cooking class, taught by Thomas…, where we made a few different pasta dishes
 - Agnolotti in an Oslo buco ragu
 - Spaghetti in an olive oil, Calabrian chili, dill, and lime sauce
 - Capaletti in an brown butter sage sauce

The class ended up going almost four hours and was a great time. On our way back, we stopped at [RivaReno]() for gelato.
