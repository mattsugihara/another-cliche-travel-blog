Title: "Tuscany on a Vespa"
Location: “Florence"
---
We woke up around 6, packed up and checked out, then taxi’d over to the Airbnb. We dropped our bags, and walked over to get coffee from [BEN Caffe]() on our way to the [Vespa scooter tour](https://tuscany-vespatours.com) meetup.

Scooting around was of course super fun, and had some incredible views. We had a really simple, tasty lunch at a farm, then headed back. Katie and I took a nap. Several hours later, we woke up and rallied, grabbing dinner at [Club culinario toscano da Osvaldo](https://www.clubosvaldo.com). We had:
 - Artichoke and Parmesan salad
 - Breaded and fried beef meatballs
 - Tortello filled with potatoes in a mushroom ragu
 - Ravioli en brodo
 - Spaghetti in a bolognese
 - Tortellini filled with cheese
The mushroom was only ok, but everything else was absolutely top notch. In particular the fried meatballs were incredibly tasty.
