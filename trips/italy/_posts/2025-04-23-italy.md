Location: "Florence"

We got up and took the 11:30 shuttle down to the city. We intended to grab a quick coffee from [Riviore](), but it turned out that Katie’s coworkers were staying just a few doors down, so they dropped by and we had a nice few rounds! After, we wandered around, eventually crossing over the Ponte Vecchio and back, before getting sandwiches. We hung out for a while at their Airbnb, then went to the Galileo museum. It’s wild how much effort humans have put into just measuring time. Some of the other surveying tools were also really cool and seriously strained my high school geometry.

We walked up to a hill overlooking the city, and hung out in the fading sunlight for a while. We then crossed back over the river into the city center and found a bunch of art galleries. There was some fun stuff (including a clock-like piece where the face/hands were two human bodies that changed positions depending on the orientation that was pretty funny), but nothing we had to take home.

Post galleries, we walked around, found a [wine windoe](bdv.one), walked through a little pop up market, and then dinner at Cibreo Caffe.
