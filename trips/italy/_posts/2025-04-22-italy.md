We woke up, took it pretty slow, and made it to the station around noon. We grabbed coffee and sandwiches from Paul, then got on the train. The train was delayed five minutes and still arrived early, which didn’t even leave us enought time to finish  [Saturday Night](). Once we arrived, we got settled, had dinner at the hotel, and went to bed.
