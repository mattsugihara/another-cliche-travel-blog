We woke up and got breakfast at the hotel. We sat out on a table that overlooked the entire city. After breakfast, we got massages, then relaxed until it was time to tour the Duomo. It was cool seeing the ~thousand years of history of this one place, repeatedly expanded, rebuilt.

Post museums, we got coffee, some gelato, and then met up with Chris and Ivee. We grabbed dinner at a steak house, and then went to bed.
