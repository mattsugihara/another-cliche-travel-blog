We woke up, got breakfast at the hotel, and then drove around the southern tip of the island. We started by heading out to the lighthouse, then just toured around.

Walked across a suspension bridge to a little nature walk to the beach. Pretty nice!

After, we grabbed beef noodle soup, but not *the* beef noodle soup, dumplings, and headed back to the hotel. aAound sunset we walked down to the beach, hung out there for a bit. When we got back, we filled the jacuzzi/bsth/o-furo on the patio of our room and hung out. everyone else was in bed by 8:30.
