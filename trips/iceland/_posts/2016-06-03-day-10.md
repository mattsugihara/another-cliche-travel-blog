title: "Bíldalur to Borgarnes"
---

Drove along fjords all day. We got to Stykkishólmur, decided that yep, it was definitely a coastal town, and then decided to head somewhere with a bit more character.

So, after dinner, we headed south, maybe to reach Reykjavik by sundown, maybe not.

We ended up in Borgarnes, a small town, and watched the sunset. We talked with Al, a nice guy who ran the desk at the hostel, and found out he was from Palestine.
