title: "Travel to Bergen"

Got into Bergen around 5pm, checked into our Airbnb, then walked along the water. Got a great salad, burger and beers at [Una](http://unabryggen.no/), then walked around a bit more. Called it a night somewhat early.

This city feels awesome! Kinda like fisherman's Wharf crossed with the mission, but not grungy and with a bit of 500 year old character. The streets are paved in cobblestones and narrow down to footpaths between houses. There's green spaces and trees everywhere. Bright colors on houses. It's fantastic.
