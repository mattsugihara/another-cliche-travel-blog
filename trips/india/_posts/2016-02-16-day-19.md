title: "Kovalam beach and travel to Delhi"

We got up early for yoga, had an ok session (The instructor tried to force me into a headstand, which is always a good maneuver), then breakfast. Bethany dashed to the airport, I packed up, then stashed my stuff with the front desk. Hung out at the Swiss cafe for a couple hours, went swimming, walked the strip, got lunch, then showered and headed to the airport. Got into Delhi around 11, hired an Uber to The Metropolitan, which turned out to be in a much nicer area than The Westin and overall more comfortable, if not quite as luxurious.
