Made it out of Delhi no problem, it was an easy flight to Zurich. I slept most of the flight, though I didn't realize it until I saw that we only had 1,100km left to fly. We got into Zurich at 6:30 as planned, then made it to the Google office there. Ate breakfast, got coffee, answered emails, took a shower, then back to the airport. Felt exactly like a Google office.

I'm beginning to think Marx had it right. I can go to basically any major city in the world, eat, sleep, shower, work out, play, or work without having to ask ANYONE. By being able to enter the building, it's proof that I have been granted the rights to do so. It's a head trip.
