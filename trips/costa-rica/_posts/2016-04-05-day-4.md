Went swimming in the morning, sprained my toe pretty bad.

Flew to la Fortuna via San Jose.

From San Jose, we had a short layover, then flew to La Fortuna.

You can *see* Volcano Arenal from the airport. So cool! This place is very reminiscent of Hawaii. Similar latitude, just friendlier.

After grocery shopping, we took the day just to lay about and relax.
