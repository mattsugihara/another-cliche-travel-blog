Woke up at 4:30 to catch our flight. Rich had a problem with his visa, and ended up getting stuck in Zurich.

The flight into Turkey was uneventful. Security took a bit longer to get through than I had anticipated, so it was lucky my flight out was delayed an hour. I went by the Turkish Lounge, got some soup and baklava, and then got on the flight home.
