Had a series of productive meetings, then took the train from Zurich to Munich. It was less than six hours (should have been five, but there were delays), but for whatever reason it felt like ten. Got in around 11:30, then went out to get dinner.

Originally we had planned to meet the teams already in Munich at [Schumann's](https://www.facebook.com/schumanns.hofgarten/), but got in too late to make it happen. Instead, the three of us wandered and eventually ended up there. Fantastic bar with great cocktails and food.

We got four rounds, then spent an hour or more walking back.
