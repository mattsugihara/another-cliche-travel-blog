Finished out the summit, then got dinner at [Gartenhof](https://www.gartenhof.net/) with our hosts. The food was very tasty, all french, and quite good. The end of the meal was disappointing, though. Dessert was meh, crepes filled with pear compote flamb√©d table side in schnapps. The show was fun, but the outcome was meh. When we paid the bill, our waiter (who was probably also the owner?) inquiried multiple times why he was not tipped and got salty about it. Buddy, half the table lives in Zurich, don't try to pull a fast one.

Once back from dinner, we headed back to our customary table in the bar and worked until about two.
