title: "Sunday: Hiking the Kalalau trail"
---

Hiked two miles along the Kalalau trail to Hanakapi'ai beach, then two miles inland to Hanakapi'ai falls. The only other place on Earth that's as pretty is the gorge we rafted through in Costa Rica. Absolutely remarkable.

Ate lunch (BLATs with Hawaian kings bread!), swam in the pool under the falls (Lepto be damned!), then hiked out. The heat was bad by the end of it and we were both ready to be done, but a few more miles wouldn't have been the worst.

We got back to the house, showered, changed, and grabbed a nice dinner at Bar Acuda. Nice, but what you're paying for is a nice meal while on vacation.
