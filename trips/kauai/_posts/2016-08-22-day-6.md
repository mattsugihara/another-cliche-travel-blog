title: "Monday: Recovery"
---

After hiking the trail the previous day, we thought it'd be best to kick back. So we took it easy. Coffee in the morning from Java Kai, a bit of shopping around Kapa'a, lunch from Anatta's, then lounging on the beach. Really good burgers from the Kalapaki beach hut, then home.

When we got home, just for shits an giggles, we went for a short run along the beach. Much to my surprise, it felt great! After dinner we did origami and drank the sparkling ros√© Amy brought with her to toast her promotion.
