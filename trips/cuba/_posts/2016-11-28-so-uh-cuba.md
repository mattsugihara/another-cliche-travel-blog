title: "So uhh...Cuba"
---

On the way home from climbing, there was a story on NPR about Fidel's death and with Trump being elected, what it could mean for US-Cuba relations. I realized that, with Trump's inauguration on January 20, this could be the last opportunity I have in my *life* to go to Cuba. So, I texted Dina asking if she had any interest in visiting Cuba. Uncharacteristically, she'd already gone to sleep for the night, but woke up the next morning and saw my text.

Turns out, Anand and Nadereh were just chatting her up about going. In fact, she almost texted me, but figured there was no way I would be able to get the time off. So uhh...Cuba.
