Woke up. Read. Breakfast at the house. Taxi to the airport.

Dealt with customs (because I didn't get a certificate when I purchased the piece, I had to pay a whole $3 to get the painting out of the country). We got on the plane. Other than the poor babies screaming behind us much of the flight, the flight was easy.
