 Those were the first words we woke up to on Saturday morning. I don't think she'll be riding again soon.
 
 Breakfast at the panaderia, taxi to El Nicho, then to Cienfuegos.

Walked around Cienfuegos.

Extremely interesting dinner. Turns out we definitely bought fake cigars. bought some rum, then hung out on the Malecon and smoked the cigar. Better than last nights, has some positive qualities, but not gonna be a regular thing.
