Woke up at 3:30 after going to bed around midnight to make the drive from Hinton to Calgary. The girls passed out most of the trip, while Wade and I passed the time bitching about work and admining the landscape as it changed from pitch black mountains to sunny mornings over farmland. It's a real pretty area.
