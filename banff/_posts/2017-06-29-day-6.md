title: "Lake Louise Gonadola and Lake Moraine"
---

We got up early and piled in the car to head over to the Lake Louise gondola. We got coffee, then took the ski lift up to the top of the mountain. Between sips of coffee, we saw a bunch of critters including a mama grizzly and her two cubs! From the top of the lift, we hiked to the summit, got some great pics, then had lunch at the Whitebark Tavern, where the food was surprisingly good.

After lunch, we headed back to the car and drove over to Lake Louise on the opposite side of the valley. We looked around a bit, then headed over to Lake Moraine. More gorgeousness.

From there, we headed home, stopping by the grocery store, and made a dinner of chicken pot pie and bacon wrapped dates. Poor Sophie took a shower and fell asleep before even eating.
