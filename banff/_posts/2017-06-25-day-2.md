Wade, again, woke me up with a cup of coffee and a lunch spread ready. After sandwiches, we sat around for a bit enjoying coffee and waking up. Once we worked up the nerve to head out, we stopped at the fab,ed Tim Hortons. while not mind blowing, it's definitely better than any chain has the right to be.

Coffee, egg mcmuffin, and doughnut in hand  we headed towards Lake Louise. We were several hours later than we had planned, so upon arrival we changed plans and hiked out the 5.5km to a tea house over avalanche torn land. It was fun!

>The land here is awe inspiring

After we got back, we hopped in the car, drove over to Lake Morian. we ran into that same couple we kept leapfrogging with on the trail, then called it for the day.

The drive back was gorgeous, then dinner and bed.
