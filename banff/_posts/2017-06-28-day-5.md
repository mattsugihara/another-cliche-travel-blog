title: "'Rest' day"

We slept in, woke up, made some lemon ricotta pancakes and scrambled eggs, then drove around. Drove up to the Norquay overlook, then checked out the lakes. It was pretty gloomy and chilly, so we headed home a bit early.

After dinner, we drove over to the Vermilion Lakes to photograph the sunset. There were more mosquitos there than I have encountered in my entire life, combined. Luckily, they only itch for a few minutes. Saw a couple beavers swimming.
