title: "First day back in Zurich"
---

Got up, had breakfast at the hotel, then spent the day at the office. Had a couple productive meetings, then walked around Zurich.

Got dinner at the Zeughauskeller (turns out it's where Bethany and I got dinner on our way to [India](/india/2016/01/29/day-1.html)!). Post dinner, we walked over to look at the Zurich opera house, then back to the hotel and sleep. Glorious, glorious sleep.
