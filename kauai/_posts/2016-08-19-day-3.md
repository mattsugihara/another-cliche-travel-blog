Went for a short run in the morning, then headed out to the Waimea Canyon for a hike. Traffic was terrible (it's worse than I remember). Hiked the out-and-back two mile trail to the falls, for which we were woefully over prepared. 7.5L water between us, about 18,000 calories, head lamp, first aid kit....

After we got shave ice, (not as good as Hee Fat) the read on [Russian Fort](https://www.google.com/maps/place/21%C2%B057'03.2%22N+159%C2%B039'56.8%22W/@21.9513238,-159.6674788,17z), until a bit before sundown.

We drove from there out to RumFire in Poipu and had poke and a drink as we watched the sunset. Grabbed dinner at Tortilla Republic (nothing special), then called it a night.

I read. Amy adorably curled up next to me and passed out cold.
