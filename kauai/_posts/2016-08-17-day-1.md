title: "Wednesday: Arriving"

Woke up after packing, got on the plane (we left a bit late/on time for me, but then the flight was delayed 45 minutes, so we ended up having time to grab breakfast).

The flight was uneventful, we read and watched Juno. After picking up our bags and car, we dropped our stuff at the rental and haded to Hamura's. I was quite satisfied. After lunch, we came back to the rental, picked up groceries from across the street, then got dinner at Bubba's and called it a night.
