Gorgeous hiking. The best so far, by a long shot. It occurred to me without strong conservative land use policy, in a country of over a billion people, if it's a place worth spending time, people will live there. So, it's really hard in India to get anywhere nice that doesn't have a village stuck there, too.

Got some great photos.
