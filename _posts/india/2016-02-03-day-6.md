Work in the morning, dance practice mid day, then a subway ride out to Lodi Gardens.

Couples everywhere.

Then, almond bread pudding, a "Cunning Stunt" (champagne, whiskey, vodka, and mediocrity). I'm guessing the place was run by Brits who think they have a sense of humor.

Lots of western music, including numerous covers. I was amused.
