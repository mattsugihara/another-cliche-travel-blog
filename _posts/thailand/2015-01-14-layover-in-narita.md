I watched a young woman dressed in a smartly tailored uniform stride through the restricted access door and up to the glass. Smiling, she faced the blubberous plane as it clumsily backed out of the gate. The woman waved and bowed towards...who? A coworker? Lover? Her most recent charge? Watching it felt wrong, like ogling a couple in the park. The barriers between them made the small act feel terribly intimate.


Before I could look away, she turned away and saw (caught?) me looking. I expected her to blush. Instead, she fixed her smile on me and walked back out the door. I went back to watching sumo and understanding none of it.
