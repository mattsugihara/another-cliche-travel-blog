Pretty much just slept and relaxed all day. It was perfect.

Matt, I'm grateful for your posts. I think you edit the experience less than KC does. Or maybe we just didn't have time during our skype to get into near-death experiences you witnessed. Then again, I'm also glad I had spoken to her after some of these posts, so I knew she had safely scootered around a crazy-traffic island with you. Thanks, from me, to your parents, too, for your scooter-skills. Or maybe KC was driving??
