Class in the morning, where we learned again, that you're supposed to breathe underwater. Then we did our first two dives. So cool!


The girls did two of their fun dives the morning, then once we were all back we grabbed dinner and called it a night. We all have to be up early tomorrow morning for our next two dives.
