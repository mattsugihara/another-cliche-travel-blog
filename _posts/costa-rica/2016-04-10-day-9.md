Woke up early, around seven, and lazed about reading. Eventually packed, then took a car to [Chelles](), a 24/7 restaurant purported to be open for over a century. Gallo pinos con huevos y carne. Great. After breakfast, we walked around San Jose, hit up a panaderia, then went back to the house to pick up our bags, then to the airport.
