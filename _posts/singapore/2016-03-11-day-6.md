Friday

Checked out of hotel, into Airbnb (holy crap, this is awesome!) then went to Forty Hands for coffee. Got pseudo lost walking and wandered through the hospital campus. Holy crap it's sparkly clean.

Had some coffee (passable) and a fairly tasty eggs Benedict with steak and curry spices (very good) at [Forty Hands().

Met up with Mitch and Justin at Tian Tian, a stall in a hawker center known for having the best chicken rice (local dish that is *exactly* that). Simple, but great flavor.

Hiking in the treetops, chili crab at Jumbo's for dinner, night market at the red dot design museum.
