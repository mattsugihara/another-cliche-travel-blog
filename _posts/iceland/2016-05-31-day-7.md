Hofn to Myvatn
Got up around 7 hikded a little bit, then got on the road to Egilsstadur. Swung south west to go to some falls, then booked it to Lake Myvatn in Reykjahlid.

Stopped at

Got dinner at Vogafjost, met a group of seven canadians, had some laughs. After dinner we went out to Krafla to check out a crater lake. We weren't sure if it was just a lake or hot spring fed, but we had our suits just in case.

clearly, the swimsuits were extraneous.

Got back to the tent, stayed up for a bit reading and talking with Amy, took a picture of the land (super bright out), then passed out.
