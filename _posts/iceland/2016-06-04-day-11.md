Borganes to Reykjavik

Woke up to a roasting room, eastern exposure, large windowns, and a nice sunny day combined to make for a warm room. We bummed around the hostel for a bit, packed up, had coffee at an interesting little coffee shop, then hit the road.

We got in to Reykjavik around noon, checked out the church, then met up with Brandon, John, and Dylan.
