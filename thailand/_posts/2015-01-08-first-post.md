I'm probably gonna take terrible pictures and have solidly vapid comments about all of them. A disproportionate share of photos will probably be of food, which unjustly, will look wholly unappealing. Elephant rides appear to be [generally terrible](https://www.google.com/search?espv=2&amp;q=elephant+ride+ethics), so we'll be skipping that particular clich√©, but everything else is fair game for recounting.
Or I might just not post anything.
